                <p> In 1937, in the service of Sardar Muhammad Bakhtiar Khan Domky my father was posted in the State of Lehri in Baluchistan. My mother, my brother and my sisters continued to live in the village. My maternal grandfather, Hadhrat Moulvi Muhammad Ilyas Khan, almost permanently lived in Mastung in Baluchistan. My father instructed us that as my uncle, Abd us Salaam Khan, was proceeding to Mastung, along with him we should travel to Lehri.</p>

                <p> In 1948 when I was a Matriculation student in Chiniot, the Headmaster once directed all students in the 9th and the 10th classes to assemble in the hall. He said that Hadhrat Syed Wali ul Allah Shah, a high-ranking office bearer of the Jamaat, would address us. His address was indeed full of fervor and enthusiasm.</p>

                <p> After I had graduated in 1953, I went to see Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih II. He directed me to be enrolled in the Jamia for the 'Shahid' Degree course. He said that it was his desire to send me into the field of Tableegh.</p>
                <br />
                <p>In accordance with Huzoor's wishes, I went to see Hadhrat Maulana Abul Ata who was then Principal of the Jamia. To begin with, he questioned me about my proficiency in Arabic. I admitted that I only had a slight knowledge of Arabic. I said that in my school and in the college I had studied Persian and therefore my knowledge of the Arabic language was limited to religious subjects. The Maulana said:</p>

                <p>A good teacher can be counted as one of the greatest gifts from the Almighty. If one has a good teacher one's whole life can get packed with numerous blessings. Prophets and saints who bring about a spiritual revolution are also teachers. They leave behind thousands of pupils who in turn spread profound knowledge throughout the world.
                    I count myself most fortunate that, through Allah's grace, I had teachers who, with their distinguished manners and vast knowledge have left an indelible mark on me. One such teacher was Hadhrat Maulana Abul Ata.</p>

                <p>In 1956, when I was a student of Jamia tul Mobbashireen, my father wrote to me saying that soon he wished to discharge his responsibility concerning my marriage. He mentioned a few names and asked for my comments. In response, I said that I would happily accept his choice. Therefore, he could settle my marriage with whomsoever he wished. A little later, he told me that he had a strong preference for Salima Nahid, a daughter of Abd ur Rahman Khan of Ismaeela.</p>
