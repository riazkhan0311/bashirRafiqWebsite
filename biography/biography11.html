                <p>In 1974 Mr Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto held the reigns of power in his hand. A few years earlier, the Jamaat Ahmadiyya had helped his 'People's Party' in the General Election as it was laid down in their Manifesto and Constitution that religion or faith is a personal matter for every individual and the government had no right to interfere. All other political parties were bitterly opposed to Ahmadiyyat and were not prepared to tolerate </p>

                <p>In 1970, I was transferred back to Pakistan and was appointed Private Secretary to Hadhrat Khalifa tul Masih III. On that occasion an address was presented which has been reproduced in the January 1971 issue of the 'Muslim Herald'. The address is reproduced below:</p>

                <p>When I first arrived in England, the Jamaat mainly consisted of young married couples and therefore there was no problem about Tarbiyyat of their children. However, in 1962 very many from Pakistan, India and East Africa migrated to England. Obviously, they came with their children. There was therefore an obvious need to organize programs for the Tarbiyyat of the children and the young on a sound basis so that our new generation may not become a victim of the western </p>

                <p>In April 1987, covering the period that I had the privilege to spend close to Chaudhry Muhammad Zafrulla Khan I wrote a book entitled 'Hadhrat Chaudhry Muhammad Zafrulla Khan - A Few Remembrances'. The book had been printed but I had only received a few copies. The remaining copies were still in the press when the Government of Pakistan confiscated all copies and instructed that, apart from me, the owner of the printing press and some </p>

                <p>Throughout his life, like a moon, Dr Saeed Ahmad Khan kept on illuminating his surroundings. He was indeed endowed with some rare and superlative attributes. He was gifted with superb principles to which he strictly adhered all his life. Fear of God and sympathy for others, were firmly ingrained in his character. He was an arch lover of Hadhrat Muhammad Mustafa SAW and of the Promised Messiah. He was passionate about calling others to the path of Allah. He was very hospitable, extremely well mannered and a true devotee to the institution of Khilafat.</p>

The last stage will be in the 'Hereafter'. During the last 72 years my vessel has been through some huge and some small whirlpools and it was pounded a great deal.
